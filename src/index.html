      <section id="about_me">
        <p>
          I am a M.Sc Computer Science student who tried his hand at lot of
          things computer-related. There's been a plethora of Unity projects,
          Rust CLI apps, CSS Designs and more that never saw the light of day,
          or the width of the web, for that matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of work, I enjoy history and games. Kingdom Come: Deliverance
          is among my Top 10. Other titles up there, are the 'ANNO' and
          'Settlers' series.

          version, too!
